========

This is a work-in-progress to dockerize [PyBitmessage](https://github.com/Bitmessage/PyBitmessage) and [bmwrapper](https://github.com/Arceliar/bmwrapper) ("a poorly hacked together python script") into one container.

The result should be able to receive and send Bitmessages and allow local email clients to manage those messages over the insecure SMTP and POP protocols.

Please be aware that software is provided as-is, and is not ready for use. Until looked at by crypto experts, this software will most likely have gaping security holes.
