bmwrapper
========

This is a work-in-progress to dockerize [bmwrapper](https://github.com/Arceliar/bmwrapper) ("a poorly hacked together python script").

The result should be able to receive and send Bitmessages with a linked PyBitmessage container,
and allow local email clients to manage those messages over the insecure SMTP and POP3 protocols.

Please be aware that software is provided as-is, and is not ready for use. Until looked at by crypto experts, this software will most likely have gaping security holes.
